                        <em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em> (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, 
                        Hepburn: JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by <b>Hirohiko Araki</b>. 
                        It was originally serialized in <u>Shueisha</u>'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1987 to 2004,

                        The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname; the eighth part, 
                        JoJolion, began its ongoing serialization in May 2011.

                        A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, 
                        was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. 
                        The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood,

                        In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting

                        frequent references to Western popular music and fashion;

                        The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date,

                        The universe of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings.
                        [2] In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (スタンド, Sutando); 
                        another significant form of energy is Hamon (波紋, "Ripple"), 
                        a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. 
                        The narrative of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. 
                        Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, 
                        whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that 
                        can be abbreviated to the titular "JoJo".[a] 
                        The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, 
                        while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.

                        Several light novels based on the manga have been written, 
                        each by a different author, but all including illustrations by Araki. 
                        The first, based on Part 3, was simply titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, 
                        released on November 4, 1993, 
                        and written by Mayori Sekijima and Hiroshi Yamaguchi.[51] 
                        Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio II: Golden Heart/Golden Ring,[k] 
                        written by Gichi Ōtsuka and Miya Shōtarō and based on Part 5, 
                        was released on May 28, 2001.[52] 
                        Both novels received Italian translations and releases; 
                        the first in 2003 with the subtitle The Genesis of Universe,[53] 
                        and the second in 2004.[54] In 2000, 
                        it was announced that Otsuichi was writing a novel based on Part 4. 
                        It proved difficult to complete; in Kono Mystery ga Sugoi! 2005, 
                        Otsuichi claimed to have written over 2000 pages, 
                        but thrown them all out.[55] His work, 
                        The Book: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 4th Another Day, 
                        was released on November 26, 2007.[56] 
                        In April 2011, it was announced that Nisio Isin, Kouhei Kadono, 
                        and Ōtarō Maijō were each writing light novels in celebration of the series' 25th anniversary.[57] 
                        Kadono's, titled Purple Haze Feedback,[l] was released on September 16, 
                        2011 and based on Part 5.[58] Nisio's, titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Over Heaven, 
                        was released on December 16, 
                        2011 and based on Part 3.[59] Maijō's novel, 
                        Jorge Joestar, was released on September 19, 2012.[60] 
                        It features characters from and inspired by nearly every part of the series.
